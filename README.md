eg:-Let's consider Delhi where a patient, Bhanu, has been experiencing persistent headaches for the past few week. He decides that it's time to see a doctor to get it checked out. Bhanu works a full-time job and has limited availability during regular business hours. He's not sure if his symptoms warrant an urgent appointment or if he can schedule a routine check-up. Bhanu prefers to book appointments online whenever possible due to his busy schedule. He wants to know the steps he needs to take to schedule a doctor's appointment and what options are available to him.
